## Ignore Visual Studio temporary files, build results, and
## files generated by popular Visual Studio add-ons.

# Build Folders (The most important part)
[Bb]in/
[Oo]bj/

# User-specific files
*.rsuser
*.suo
*.user
*.userosscache
*.sln.docstates

# Visual Studio / Rider specific
.vs/
.vscode/
.idea/

# Windows image file caches
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db

# Folder config file
Desktop.ini

# Recycle Bin used on file shares
$RECYCLE.BIN/

# Mac
.DS_Store

# Logs
*.log

# NuGet
*.nuget.props
*.nuget.targets

# User specific appsettings (Security best practice)
# You generally want to commit 'appsettings.json' but IGNORE 'appsettings.Development.json'
# or any local override files containing secrets.
appsettings.Development.json
appsettings.Local.json
*.pid
